What is the problem?
In our testing phase, we are unable to locate NextUI components. We continue to get undefined or unable to locate item. We are trying to implement testing to check if a button renders to the page.

=========
What did I expect to happen?
When we query the data, we would be able to pull that specified info and save it into a variable to test.

===========================
What have I already tried?
-different sets of query methods ([get/find] by [Text/LabelText/Role])
-made sure our component render
-using screen
-using async/await
-Check both API documentations in Jest and React Testing Library
-Referred to past units as references
-checked the correct (dev)dependecies

==================
Why I suspect itâ€™s not working
We are likely not querying the right elements to extract the infomation. NextUI names elements something differently.
